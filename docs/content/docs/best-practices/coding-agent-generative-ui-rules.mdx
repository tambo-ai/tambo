title: Coding Agent MD Rules
description: Concise rules for AI coding agents working with Tambo generative UI.
---

We highly recommend adding these rules to your Coding agent `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` or similar AI assistant configuration file.

Adding these will often avoid common issues and improve the assistants integration.

```markdown
## Tambo Generative UI

- Props are `undefined` during streaming—always use `?.` and `??`
- Use `useTamboComponentState` for state the assistant needs to see
- Use `useTamboStreamStatus` when you need to control UI behavior based on streaming state
- Common `useTamboStreamStatus` use cases: disabling buttons, showing section-level loading, waiting for required fields before rendering
- String props can render as they stream; structured data like arrays/objects may stream progressively or wait for completion depending on the use case
- Generate array item IDs client-side—React keys must be stable, and AI-generated IDs are unreliable during streaming
- If the item IDs are used to fetch data, use `useTamboStreamStatus` to wait until the array is complete before rendering
- Fetch server data or derive from app state; don't have AI generate what already exists
- Use `.describe()` to guide prop generation
```
