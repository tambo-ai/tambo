## Configuration Hierarchy

Tambo's agent configuration operates across three levels:

1. **Project-level** - Default settings that apply to all conversations in a project (custom instructions, LLM provider, token limits)
2. **Thread-level** - Optional conversation-specific overrides (when `allowSystemPromptOverride` is enabled)
3. **Message-level** - Dynamic runtime context via [additional context](/docs/concepts/additional-context) helpers

For a deeper understanding of how these levels work together, see the [Agent Configuration concept](/docs/concepts/agent-configuration).

## Quick Start

New to agent configuration? Follow these steps:

1. **Start with Project Settings** - Create a project and set up basic configuration
2. **Configure Your LLM Provider** - Select a model provider and configure authentication
3. **Customize Agent Behavior** - Apply practical patterns to optimize for your use case

Each guide includes step-by-step instructions, examples, and troubleshooting tips.
