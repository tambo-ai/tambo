Learn how to create a new Tambo project through the dashboard to start building AI-powered applications.

## Step 1: Sign Up or Log In

Go to [tambo.co](https://tambo.co) and create an account or log in to your existing account.

## Step 2: Create a New Project

1. Click "New Project" or "Create Project" in the dashboard
2. Enter a project name (e.g., "My Chat App")
3. Optionally add a description to help you remember the project's purpose

## Step 3: Get Your API Key

1. Navigate to your project settings
2. Find the "API Keys" section
3. Copy your project API key
4. Store it securely (never commit to version control)

<Callout type="warn" title="Keep your API key secure">
  Never commit your API key to version control or expose it in client-side code. Always use environment variables.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Add to Your Application

Add the API key to your environment variables:

```bash title=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_PROJECT_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then pass it to TamboProvider in your application:

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <TamboProvider projectKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_PROJECT_KEY}>
          {children}
        </TamboProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
