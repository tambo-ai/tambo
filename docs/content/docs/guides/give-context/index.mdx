When building AI applications, you need to provide context so Tambo understands the user's situation and environment. Choose the right approach based on what you're trying to achieve.

## What Do You Need?

### Make AI Aware of Current State

The AI needs to know where the user is, what they're looking at, and their current session—automatically, on every message.

**Use:** [Context Helpers: Make AI Aware of State](/guides/give-context/make-ai-aware-of-state)

Context helpers run automatically with every message, providing ambient information without requiring explicit code in your components.

**Examples:**

- Current page URL and title
- User session data (ID, role, permissions)
- Time and timezone
- App state (selected items, active filters)
- Feature flags and environment info

### Let Users Attach Specific Information

Users should be able to explicitly include files, selections, or specific items in their messages.

**Use:** [Context Attachments: Let Users Attach Context](/guides/give-context/let-users-attach-context)

Context attachments are temporary, user-driven context that's staged before sending a message and automatically cleared afterward.

**Examples:**

- File uploads
- Text selections
- Canvas or workspace elements
- Screenshots or images
- Specific data records

### Give Users a Library to Reference

Users should be able to @ mention documentation, data sources, or knowledge bases in their messages.

**Use:** [Resources: Make Context Referenceable](/guides/give-context/make-context-referenceable)

Resources are discoverable, referenceable content that users can explicitly include by @ mentioning them.

**Examples:**

- Documentation and guides
- Database records
- API responses
- User-uploaded documents
- Knowledge base articles

## Combining Approaches

Most applications use multiple approaches together. Here's how they work in combination:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider, useTamboContextAttachment } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { currentTimeContextHelper, currentPageContextHelper } from "@tambo-ai/react";

// 1. Context helpers provide automatic ambient context
<TamboProvider
  contextHelpers={{
    userTime: currentTimeContextHelper,
    userPage: currentPageContextHelper,
    session: async () => ({
      userId: getCurrentUserId(),
      role: getUserRole(),
    }),
  }}
>
  <App />
</TamboProvider>

// 2. Users attach specific files when needed
function FileUploader() {
  const { addContextAttachment } = useTamboContextAttachment();

  const handleFileSelect = (file: File) => {
    addContextAttachment({
      context: await file.text(),
      displayName: file.name,
      type: "file",
    });
  };
}

// 3. Users @ mention documentation from resources
<TamboRegistryProvider
  resources={[
    {
      uri: "docs://api-reference",
      name: "API Reference",
      description: "Complete API documentation",
      mimeType: "text/plain",
    },
  ]}
  getResource={async (uri) => {
    return {
      contents: [{ uri, mimeType: "text/plain", text: "..." }],
    };
  }}
>
```

**Together, these provide:**

- **Context helpers**: Automatic environment data (session, page, time)
- **Context attachments**: User-selected temporary context (files, selections)
- **Resources**: Referenceable documentation and knowledge
