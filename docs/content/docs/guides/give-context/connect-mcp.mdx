title: Connect MCP Servers for Context
description: Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to provide additional context resources to Tambo.
---

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers can provide **context resources** that help Tambo understand your data better. Resources include things like:

- Database records and schemas
- File contents and documentation
- API documentation and specifications
- System state and configuration

MCP servers expose these resources through a standardized protocol, making it easy for Tambo to access and use them when generating responses.

## Learn More About MCP

For a complete guide on connecting and using MCP servers in your Tambo application, see:

- [Connect External Data Sources](/docs/guides/first-components/connect-data-sources) - Full MCP integration guide

This guide covers:
- Setting up MCP servers
- Configuring server connections
- Using resources in your application
- Server-side vs client-side architectures
- Rich content support and elicitations

## Context-Specific Features

MCP servers provide several features specifically for context:

- **Resources**: Access to files, databases, and APIs
- **Prompts**: Pre-configured prompt templates with context
- **Elicitations**: Interactive data collection from users

These features help Tambo generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses based on your application's data.
