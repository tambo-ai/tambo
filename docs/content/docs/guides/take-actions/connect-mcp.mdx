title: Connect MCP Servers for Actions
description: Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to provide tools that Tambo can execute to take actions.
---

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers can provide **tools** that Tambo can execute to take actions in your application. Tools enable Tambo to:

- Query databases and APIs
- Create, update, or delete records
- Execute system commands
- Interact with external services
- Perform calculations and transformations

MCP servers expose these tools through a standardized protocol, making it easy for Tambo to discover and execute them when needed.

## Learn More About MCP

For a complete guide on connecting and using MCP servers in your Tambo application, see:

- [Connect External Data Sources](/docs/guides/first-components/connect-data-sources) - Full MCP integration guide

This guide covers:
- Setting up MCP servers
- Configuring server connections
- Using tools in your application
- Server-side vs client-side architectures
- Rich content support and sampling

## Action-Specific Features

MCP servers provide several features specifically for actions:

- **Tools**: Executable functions with defined parameters
- **Sampling**: AI-powered decision making and planning
- **Rich Content**: Structured responses with images, files, and more

These features allow Tambo to perform complex operations and interact with your application's systems in meaningful ways.
