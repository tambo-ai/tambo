This guide covers taking your local Docker Compose setup to production.

## Production environment

Update `docker.env` for production:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Reverse proxy

Add a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, or Traefik) in front of the web and API services for HTTPS termination. Point the proxy to:

- **Web**: port 8260
- **API**: port 8261

> **Note:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_URL` must be reachable from the browser and should point to the public URL exposed by your reverse proxy for the API. `http://localhost:8261` is fine for local development, but in production you should set it to your public API URL (for example `https://api.your-domain.com` or `https://your-domain.com/api`), not `localhost` or an internal Docker hostname.

## Building and pushing images

Build the Docker images locally:

```bash
./scripts/cloud/tambo-build.sh
```

Tag and push to your container registry:

```bash
docker tag tambo-web:latest your-registry/tambo-web:latest
docker tag tambo-api:latest your-registry/tambo-api:latest
docker push your-registry/tambo-web:latest
docker push your-registry/tambo-api:latest
```
