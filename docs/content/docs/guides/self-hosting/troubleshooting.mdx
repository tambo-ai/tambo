Solutions to the most common problems with self-hosted Tambo.

## Services won't start

1. Check Docker is running: `docker info`
2. Check `docker.env` exists and has all required variables
3. View logs: `./scripts/cloud/tambo-logs.sh`

## Database connection errors

1. Verify PostgreSQL is healthy:
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file docker.env ps postgres
   ```
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set (auto-derived from `POSTGRES_*` variables)

## OAuth not working

1. Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your deployment URL exactly (no trailing slash)
2. Check OAuth callback URLs in provider settings match your deployment
3. Ensure both `_CLIENT_ID` and `_CLIENT_SECRET` are set for the provider

## Full reset

Stop and remove all containers and volumes, then start fresh:

```bash
# Stop and remove containers + volumes
docker compose --env-file docker.env down -v
docker volume rm tambo_tambo_postgres_data

# Start fresh
./scripts/cloud/tambo-start.sh
./scripts/cloud/init-database.sh
```
