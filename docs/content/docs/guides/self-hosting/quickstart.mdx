Follow these steps to go from zero to a running Tambo Cloud instance on your machine using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- OpenAI API key (or compatible provider)

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo.git
cd tambo
```

## 2. Set up environment

```bash
./scripts/cloud/tambo-setup.sh
```

This creates `docker.env` from `docker.env.example`.

## 3. Configure environment variables

Edit `docker.env` with your values. At minimum, set:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
API_KEY_SECRET=your-32-character-api-key-secret
PROVIDER_KEY_SECRET=your-32-character-provider-secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
FALLBACK_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

`docker.env.example` includes placeholder values. Replace them with strong secrets before starting the stack.

See [Environment Variables](/guides/self-hosting/environment-variables) for the full reference.

## 4. Start services

```bash
./scripts/cloud/tambo-start.sh
```

## 5. Initialize database

```bash
./scripts/cloud/init-database.sh
```

## 6. Access your deployment

- **Web Dashboard**: http://localhost:8260
- **API**: http://localhost:8261

## What's next

You now have a local Tambo Cloud deployment. To take it further:

- [Set up authentication](/guides/self-hosting/authentication) so users can sign in
- [Deploy to production with Docker Compose](/guides/self-hosting/docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](/guides/self-hosting/kubernetes)
- [Learn the operational scripts](/guides/self-hosting/scripts) for managing your deployment
