title: Connect MCP Servers
description: Configure Model Context Protocol servers to extend Tambo with external tools and data
---

This guide shows you how to connect MCP servers to your Tambo application, both through the Tambo dashboard (server-side) and directly in your React code (client-side).

For an overview of MCP and when to use each connection type, see [Model Context Protocol](/concepts/model-context-protocol).

## Prerequisites

- A Tambo project set up with `TamboProvider`
- For client-side MCP: Install peer dependencies

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.24.0 zod@^4.0.0 zod-to-json-schema@^3.25.0
```

## Server-side Connection (Recommended)

Server-side MCP connections are configured through the Tambo dashboard and run on Tambo's infrastructure. This provides better performance and supports OAuth authentication.

### Step 1: Navigate to MCP Settings

1. Go to your [Tambo dashboard](https://tambo.co/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Find the "MCP Servers" section
4. Click "Add MCP Server"

### Step 2: Configure the Server

Enter the MCP server details:

- **Server URL**: The endpoint URL (e.g., `https://mcp.linear.app`)
- **Server Type**: Choose between `StreamableHTTP` or `SSE` based on the server's protocol
- **Server Key** (optional): A stable identifier for namespacing (e.g., `linear`)

Click "Save" to create the connection.

### Step 3: Authenticate (If Required)

If the MCP server requires authentication:

1. A "Begin Authentication" button will appear
2. Click it to start the OAuth flow
3. Complete authentication in the popup window
4. The server status will update to "Connected"

The OAuth identity is currently shared across all users of your project. Only configure servers where this shared access is acceptable.

### Step 4: Verify Connection

The MCP server is now available to your application. No client-side code changes are needed - Tambo automatically makes the server's capabilities available.

Test by asking your AI assistant to use tools from the connected server.

## Client-side Connection

Client-side MCP connections run in the user's browser, allowing access to local servers and leveraging browser authentication.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.24.0 zod@^4.0.0 zod-to-json-schema@^3.25.0
```

### Step 2: Configure MCP Servers

Add the `mcpServers` prop to your `TamboProvider`:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { MCPTransport } from "@tambo-ai/react/mcp";

function App() {
  return (
    <TamboProvider
      components={components}
      mcpServers={[
        {
          url: "http://localhost:8123/",
          serverKey: "local",
          transport: MCPTransport.HTTP,
        },
      ]}
    >
      <YourApp />
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Add Custom Headers (Optional)

If your MCP server requires authentication headers:

```tsx
<TamboProvider
  mcpServers={[
    {
      url: "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      serverKey: "example",
      customHeaders: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`,
        "X-Api-Key": "your-api-key",
      },
      transport: MCPTransport.HTTP,
    },
  ]}
>
  <YourApp />
</TamboProvider>
```

### Step 4: Test the Connection

The MCP server is now connected. Test by:

1. Starting your development server
2. Opening your application
3. Trying to use MCP features (prompts, resources, tools)

Check the browser console for connection status and any errors.

## Multiple MCP Servers

You can connect multiple MCP servers simultaneously:

```tsx
<TamboProvider
  mcpServers={[
    {
      url: "https://mcp.linear.app",
      serverKey: "linear",
      transport: MCPTransport.HTTP,
    },
    {
      url: "https://mcp.github.com",
      serverKey: "github",
      transport: MCPTransport.HTTP,
    },
    {
      url: "http://localhost:8123/",
      serverKey: "local",
      transport: MCPTransport.HTTP,
    },
  ]}
>
  <YourApp />
</TamboProvider>
```

Each server's capabilities are prefixed with its `serverKey` to prevent naming conflicts.

## Server Key Best Practices

The `serverKey` is used to namespace MCP capabilities:

- **Tools**: `serverKey__toolName` (e.g., `linear__create_issue`)
- **Prompts**: `serverKey:promptName` (e.g., `linear:new-issue`)
- **Resources**: Varies by connection type

Follow these guidelines:

1. **Explicit is better**: Always set `serverKey` rather than relying on URL-derived keys
2. **Environment-aware**: Use different keys per environment (e.g., `linear-staging`, `linear-prod`)
3. **Avoid special characters**: Use only letters, numbers, `_`, and `-`
4. **Don't use separators**: Avoid `:` and `__` (reserved for namespacing)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Fails

**Server-side:**
- Verify the server URL is correct and accessible from Tambo's infrastructure
- Check that the server type (StreamableHTTP/SSE) matches the server's protocol
- Ensure authentication is completed if required

**Client-side:**
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify the server URL is accessible from the browser
- Confirm peer dependencies are installed correctly

### Tools Not Appearing

- Wait a few seconds for the MCP server to initialize
- Check that the server is returning tools in its capabilities
- Verify the `serverKey` is unique across all connected servers

### Authentication Issues

**Server-side:**
- Ensure you completed the OAuth flow
- Check token expiration in the dashboard
- Try re-authenticating by clicking "Begin Authentication" again

**Client-side:**
- OAuth is not currently supported for client-side connections
- Use `customHeaders` for API key authentication instead
- Ensure the browser has existing session cookies if relying on session auth
