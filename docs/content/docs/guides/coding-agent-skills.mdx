Install Tambo skills to teach your AI coding agent how to build React apps with generative UI.

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Windsurf, and [35+ other agents](https://skills.sh).

## Install Skills

```bash
npx skills add tambo-ai/tambo
```

This installs 5 skills that teach your agent the Tambo SDK:

| Skill                 | What Your Agent Learns                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `components`          | Register and render generative UI components         |
| `component-rendering` | Streaming states, optimistic updates, error handling |
| `threads`             | Thread management, suggestions, voice input          |
| `tools-and-context`   | Custom tools, MCP servers, context helpers           |
| `cli`                 | Project setup with `npx tambo init`                  |

## Quick Start

After installing the skills, ask your coding agent:

> "Create a new Tambo app with a weather dashboard component"

Your agent will use the skills to scaffold your project and build AI-powered components.

## What You Can Build

With Tambo skills installed, your coding agent can help you:

- **Create new projects** - Scaffold a complete Tambo app with `npx tambo init`
- **Add generative components** - Register React components that AI can render dynamically
- **Build chat interfaces** - Create conversational UIs with streaming responses
- **Connect tools** - Give AI access to your app's data and actions
- **Integrate MCP servers** - Connect to external services and APIs

## Example Prompts

Try these prompts after installing Tambo skills:

- "Initialize a new Tambo project with TypeScript"
- "Create a ProductCard component that Tambo can render"
