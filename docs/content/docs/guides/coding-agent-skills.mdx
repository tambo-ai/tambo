Install Tambo skills to teach your AI coding agent how to build React apps with generative UI.

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Windsurf, and [35+ other agents](https://skills.sh).

## Install Skills

```bash
npx skills add tambo-ai/tambo
```

This installs 8 skills that teach your agent the Tambo SDK:

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `components`                 | Register and render generative UI components                 |
| `component-rendering`        | Streaming states, optimistic updates, error handling         |
| `threads`                    | Thread management, suggestions, voice input                  |

| `add-components-to-registry` | Convert existing components into Tambo generative components |

## Quick Start

After installing the skills, ask your coding agent:

> "Create a new Tambo app with a weather dashboard component"

Your agent will use the skills to scaffold your project and build AI-powered components.

## What You Can Build

With Tambo skills installed, your coding agent can help you:

- **Create new projects** - Scaffold a complete Tambo app with `npx tambo init`
- **Add generative components** - Register React components that AI can render dynamically
- **Build chat interfaces** - Create conversational UIs with streaming responses
- **Connect tools** - Give AI access to your app's data and actions
- **Integrate MCP servers** - Connect to external services and APIs

## Example Prompts

Try these prompts after installing Tambo skills:

- "Create a new Tambo project with Next.js and Tailwind"
- "Add Tambo to my existing React app"
- "Register my ProductCard component so Tambo can render it"
