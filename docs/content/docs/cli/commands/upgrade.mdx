`npx tambo upgrade`

Upgrades your entire tambo project including npm packages, components, and cursor rules to the latest versions.

**What it upgrades:**

1. **NPM Packages**: Updates known safe packages (UI components, utilities, and tambo dependencies)
2. **Components**: Updates all installed tambo components to latest versions
3. **Cursor Rules**: Updates AI coding assistant rules for better development experience
4. **Configuration**: Updates CSS variables and Tailwind configuration as needed

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive upgrade with prompts
npx tambo upgrade

# Auto-accept all changes
npx tambo upgrade --accept-all

# Upgrade with custom component directory
npx tambo upgrade --prefix=src/components/ui

# Use legacy peer deps
npx tambo upgrade --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Safe Package Updates

The upgrade command only updates packages that are known to be safe for automatic updates:

<Callout type="info" title="Smart Package Filtering">
  The CLI automatically filters to only show updates for UI components,
  utilities, and tambo-specific packages. Core framework packages (like React,
  Next.js, TypeScript) are excluded to prevent breaking changes.
</Callout>

**Safe packages include:**

- tambo packages (`@tambo-ai/react`, `@tambo-ai/typescript-sdk`)
- UI components (`@radix-ui/*`, `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`)
- Styling utilities (`tailwindcss`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`)
- Development tools (`eslint-config-next`, `@types/*`)

## Configuration Updates

The upgrade command performs comprehensive updates to your project configuration:

### CSS & Tailwind Updates

The CLI will update your `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` files to ensure they're compatible with the latest tambo components and your current Tailwind CSS version.

<Callout type="info" title="Safe Configuration Updates">
  The upgrade process preserves your existing styles and configuration while
  adding any new CSS variables required by updated components.
</Callout>

### What Gets Updated

- **CSS Variables**: New variables required by component updates
- **Tailwind Configuration**: Basic configuration for v3 projects
- **Component Dependencies**: Latest versions of all component dependencies
- **Package Versions**: Updates to known safe packages only

<Callout type="warn" title="Backup Recommendation">
  While the CLI creates automatic backups, consider committing your changes to
  version control before running `upgrade` to ensure you can easily revert if
  needed.
</Callout>
