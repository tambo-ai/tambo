title: REST API
description: OpenAPI specification for the Tambo Cloud REST API
---

The Tambo Cloud REST API provides programmatic access to threads, messages, and AI generation capabilities.

## OpenAPI Specification

The complete REST API is documented via an interactive OpenAPI specification available at:

**[api.tambo.co/api](https://api.tambo.co/api)**

The OpenAPI spec includes:

- All available endpoints with request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Interactive "Try it out" functionality
- Code generation for multiple languages

## Authentication

All API requests require a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.tambo.co/threads
```

Get your API key from the [Tambo Cloud dashboard](https://console.tambo.co).

## Common Endpoints

| Endpoint                     | Method | Description                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `/threads`                   | GET    | List all threads for your project      |
| `/threads`                   | POST   | Create a new thread                    |
| `/threads/:id`               | GET    | Get a specific thread with messages    |
| `/threads/:id/advance`       | POST   | Send a message and get AI response     |
| `/threads/:id/advancestream` | POST   | Send a message with streaming response |

## Error Responses

The API uses [RFC 9457 Problem Details](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html) for error responses. Each error response includes a `type` field with a URI that links to detailed documentation about that specific problem.

### Common Problem Types

- **[Endpoint Deprecated](/reference/problems/endpoint-deprecated)** - Returned when calling a deprecated endpoint (410 Gone)

## SDKs

For most use cases, we recommend using one of the official SDKs instead of direct REST calls:

- **React**: [`@tambo-ai/react`](/reference/react-sdk) - Full-featured React SDK with hooks and providers
- **TypeScript/Node**: [`@tambo-ai/typescript-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tambo-ai/typescript-sdk) - Core TypeScript client
