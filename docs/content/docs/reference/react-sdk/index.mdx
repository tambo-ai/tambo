---

The `@tambo-ai/react` package is Tambo's official React SDK for building AI-powered generative UI applications. This reference documents all public APIs including hooks, types, utilities, and provider components.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @tambo-ai/react
```

## Quick Links

- [Hooks](/reference/react-sdk/hooks) - React hooks for thread management, component state, streaming, and more
- [Types](/reference/react-sdk/types) - TypeScript interfaces and types for type-safe development
- [Utilities](/reference/react-sdk/utilities) - Helper functions like `defineTool()` and `withInteractable()`
- [Providers](/reference/react-sdk/providers) - Provider components for configuring Tambo in your app
- [MCP](/reference/react-sdk/mcp) - Model Context Protocol hooks and types

## Overview

The SDK is organized around a provider hierarchy that manages AI state and configuration:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <TamboProvider
      apiKey={process.env.TAMBO_API_KEY}
      components={
        [
          /* your components */
        ]
      }
      tools={
        [
          /* your tools */
        ]
      }
    >
      <YourApp />
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

Inside the provider, use hooks to access Tambo functionality:

```tsx
import {
  useTambo,
  useTamboThread,
  useTamboStreamStatus,
} from "@tambo-ai/react";

function Chat() {
  const { sendThreadMessage, thread } = useTamboThread();
  const { streamStatus } = useTamboStreamStatus();
  // Build your UI
}
```

## MCP Support

For Model Context Protocol integrations, import from the `/mcp` subpath:

```tsx
import { TamboMcpProvider, useTamboMcpServers } from "@tambo-ai/react/mcp";
```

MCP requires additional peer dependencies. See the [MCP reference](/reference/react-sdk/mcp) for setup instructions.
