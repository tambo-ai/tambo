title: Endpoint deprecated
description: Problem details returned when you call an endpoint that has been removed.
---

Tambo Cloud uses a JSON Problem Details response (RFC 9457 / RFC 7807) to indicate that an endpoint has been deprecated/removed.

## Type URI

`https://docs.tambo.co/api-reference/problems/endpoint-deprecated`

## Example response

This problem type is returned with HTTP status `410 Gone`.

```json
{
  "type": "https://docs.tambo.co/api-reference/problems/endpoint-deprecated",
  "status": 410,
  "title": "Endpoint Deprecated",
  "detail": "The non-streaming /advance endpoint has been deprecated. Please use /advancestream instead.",
  "code": "ENDPOINT_DEPRECATED",
  "instance": "/threads/advance",
  "details": {
    "migrateToEndpoint": "POST /advancestream"
  }
}
```

## Fields

- `code`: Stable identifier for programmatic handling (always `ENDPOINT_DEPRECATED` for this type).
- `detail`: Human-readable description of the deprecation.
- `instance`: The request path that triggered the problem.
- `details.migrateToEndpoint`: Migration guidance (HTTP method + replacement endpoint).
