`npx tambo init`

Walks you through creating a Tambo project and getting your free API Key. If you don't already have an account, <a href="https://tambo.co/dashboard" className="text-secondary hover:underline font-medium">sign up for free</a> to get your API key.

After obtaining your API key, you'll need to set it up in your project:

<Callout type="info" title="API Key Setup">
  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project to store your Tambo API
  key: ``` NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here ``` Replace
  `your_api_key_here` with the actual API key you received during setup. This
  file should not be committed to version control as it contains sensitive
  information.
</Callout>

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive setup with hosting choice
npx tambo init

# Skip prompts and use defaults
npx tambo init --yes

# Use legacy peer deps
npx tambo init --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Hosting Options

The init command offers two hosting options for your Tambo project:

### Tambo Cloud (Recommended)

**Setup time:** ~1 minute

The fastest way to get started. Tambo Cloud handles all backend infrastructure for you.

**What you get:**

- Hosted AI backend
- Automatic scaling
- No infrastructure to manage
- Free tier available

**When to choose:**

- You want to start quickly
- You don't want to manage backend infrastructure
- You're building a prototype or MVP
- You want automatic updates and scaling

### Self-Hosted

**Setup time:** ~5-10 minutes

Run the Tambo backend on your own infrastructure using Docker.

**What's required:**

- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic terminal/command line knowledge
- Port 3030 available

**When to choose:**

- You need full control over your infrastructure
- You have data residency requirements
- You want to customize the backend
- You're deploying to your own servers

**Setup steps shown:**

After selecting self-host, the CLI provides detailed instructions:

```bash
? How would you like to host your Tambo project?
  ❯ Tambo Cloud (~1 minute) [Recommended]
    Self-host (~5-10 minutes)

# If self-host selected:
To self-host Tambo:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-core.git
   cd tambo-core/tambo-cloud

2. Run the start script:
   ./scripts/tambo-start.sh

3. Your API will be running at http://localhost:3030

4. Set this in your .env.local:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_URL=http://localhost:3030

? Continue with self-host setup? (Y/n)
```

## Project Setup Flow

### Source Directory Detection

The init command automatically detects your project structure and helps set up the correct directory:

```bash
✓ Checking project structure...
ℹ Found existing src/ directory

? Where should components be installed?
  ❯ Use existing src/ directory
    Create new src/ directory
```

**What happens:**

- If `src/` exists, CLI offers to use it
- If no `src/` exists, CLI offers to create one
- Components will be installed relative to your choice

**Directory structure created:**

```
your-project/
├── src/                    # If selected
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── tambo/         # Tambo components
│   └── lib/
│       └── tambo.ts       # Component registration
└── .env.local             # API key (not committed)
```

Or without `src/`:

```
your-project/
├── components/
│   └── tambo/             # Tambo components
├── lib/
│   └── tambo.ts           # Component registration
└── .env.local             # API key (not committed)
```

### API Key Management

The init command protects your existing API keys:

**If API key already exists:**

```bash
✓ Checking for existing API key...
⚠ Found existing API key in .env.local

? An API key already exists. What would you like to do?
  ❯ Keep existing key
    Replace with new key
    Skip API key setup
```

**Files checked (in order):**

1. `.env.local`
2. `.env`

**Why this matters:**

- Prevents accidentally overwriting your production API key
- Lets you keep existing configuration
- Avoids breaking existing deployments

**Best practice:**

If you're not sure which key is in your `.env.local`, check it first:

```bash
cat .env.local | grep TAMBO_API_KEY
```
