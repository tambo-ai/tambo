Tools are functions that allow Tambo to take actions in response to natural language. When a user asks "What's the weather in San Francisco?", Tambo can use a registered tool that calls a weather API, retrieves current data, and use that data to populate a `WeatherDisplay` component.

## Tambo's Approaches for Enabling Tools

### Local Tools

Local tools are JavaScript functions that execute in your React app, defined by you and registered with Tambo. When processing a user message, Tambo may decide to use tools you have registered to retrieve information or to take actions. Local tools allow you to easily extend the capabilities of Tambo.

```tsx
const getWeather = (city: string) => {
  return `The weather in ${city} is warm and sunny!`;
};

export const weatherTool: TamboTool = {
  name: "getWeather",
  description: "A tool to get the current weather conditions of a city",
  tool: getWeather,
  toolSchema: z
    .function()
    .args(z.string().describe("The city name to get weather information for"))
    .returns(z.string()),
};

<TamboProvider tools={[weatherTool]}>
  <App />
</TamboProvider>;
```

### MCP Tools

MCP tools come from external servers that package tool definitions and implementations into reusable services. Services like Linear and GitHub provide MCP servers, letting you gain powerful integrations without writing them yourself, or as a way to expose your own API to Tambo. MCP tools are automatically discovered and made available to Tambo when you connect to an MCP server (either server-side or client-side).
