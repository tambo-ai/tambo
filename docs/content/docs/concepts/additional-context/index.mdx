When users interact with Tambo, the AI doesn't just see their message—it needs to understand their environment, what page they're on, what time it is, and what other information is relevant. Without this context, every conversation happens in a vacuum.

Think of additional context as layers of information that help the AI see what you see. These layers work together to give the AI a complete picture of each interaction.

## The Context Problem

Imagine a user asks "What's next on my schedule?" The message alone doesn't tell the AI:
- What time it is now (morning? afternoon?)
- What timezone the user is in
- What page they're looking at (calendar? dashboard?)
- What project they have selected
- What files or documents they've been working with

Additional context solves this by automatically or explicitly including relevant information with each message.

## Five Ways to Provide Context

Tambo offers five complementary approaches to context, each suited for different types of information:

### Automatic Context (Context Helpers)

Context helpers run automatically with every message, providing ambient information that's always relevant. This is ideal for data that changes between messages but should always be available to the AI.

**When to use**: Current time, active page, user authentication state, selected project, app settings

**Characteristics**:
- Runs on every message automatically
- Updates dynamically as state changes
- No user action required
- Best for frequently-referenced data

### Per-Message Context (Manual Context)

Sometimes context is specific to a single interaction—search filters, form data, or temporary state that applies to just this message. Manual context lets you include this programmatically when sending messages.

**When to use**: Search parameters, form submissions, filter selections, interaction-specific data

**Characteristics**:
- Included only with specific messages
- Controlled programmatically in your code
- Doesn't persist beyond the message
- Best for one-off contextual data

### Staged Context (Context Attachments)

Context attachments let users explicitly stage context they want to include in their next message. Think of it like a clipboard—users select files, highlight text, or focus on specific elements, and that context gets included once, then automatically cleared.

**When to use**: File contents, text selections, canvas elements, temporary user-controlled context

**Characteristics**:
- User-initiated (they choose what to include)
- Staged before sending
- Automatically cleared after submission (one-time use)
- Best for explicit, temporary context

### Thread Context (System Messages)

System messages set persistent instructions that guide the entire conversation. Unlike context that changes with each message, system messages establish the AI's role, expertise, and behavioral constraints for the thread's lifetime.

**When to use**: AI persona, domain expertise, persistent behavioral rules, conversation-level instructions

**Characteristics**:
- Set once at thread creation
- Persists for entire conversation
- Can't be changed after creation
- Best for instructions that don't change

### User-Referenced Context (Resources)

Resources allow users to explicitly pull in documentation, files, or other content by typing @ and selecting what they want to reference. The content is included in the message when sent.

**When to use**: Documentation, reference files, knowledge base articles, user-uploaded documents

**Characteristics**:
- User-controlled (@ mention syntax)
- Searchable and browsable
- Included in message when referenced
- Best for large reference materials

## Comparing Context Methods

Different context methods serve different purposes. Here's how they compare:

| Method | Automatic/Manual | Persistent | Initiated By | Best For |
|--------|-----------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Context Helpers | Automatic | Per-message | System | Ambient data (time, page, state) |
| Manual Context | Manual | Per-message | Developer | Interaction-specific data |
| Context Attachments | Manual | One-time | User | Temporary user selections |
| System Messages | Manual | Thread lifetime | Developer | Persistent instructions |
| Resources | Manual | Per-message | User | Reference documentation |

The key distinction is between **automatic** context (helpers run without user action) and **explicit** context (user or developer chooses when to include it).

Another important distinction is **persistence**: context helpers and resources work per-message, while system messages persist for the entire thread.

## Layered Context: How Methods Combine

These five methods aren't mutually exclusive—they work together to provide comprehensive context:

```
Thread Start: System message establishes AI role and constraints
    ↓
Message 1:
  • Context helpers provide current time, page, user state
  • User attaches a file via context attachment
  • User references docs via @ mention
  • Developer includes form data via manual context
    ↓
Message 2:
  • Same context helpers run again (new data)
  • Context attachment cleared (one-time use)
  • User references different docs
    ↓
Thread continues...
```

All context layers merge together when sending each message. The AI receives:
- **Persistent foundation**: System message instructions
- **Dynamic environment**: Context helpers (time, page, state)
- **User selections**: Context attachments and resources
- **Interaction data**: Manual context

This layered approach gives the AI both broad environmental awareness and specific contextual details for each interaction.

## When Each Method Matters

**Use context helpers when** you need the AI to always know certain information—current page, time, authenticated user, active project. This becomes the AI's baseline awareness.

**Use manual context when** you're programmatically including data specific to an interaction—search filters on a search page, form values on submission, selected options.

**Use context attachments when** users need control over what context to include—letting them focus the AI on specific files, text selections, or workspace elements.

**Use system messages when** you need to establish persistent instructions—AI persona that doesn't change, domain expertise that applies to every response, behavioral rules.

**Use resources when** users need to reference large documentation or files—API docs, knowledge base articles, user-uploaded documents that shouldn't be in every message.
