title: Additional Context
description: Add additional information along with user's message
---

Additional Context helps you add information that will be sent along with the user's message. You can include prebuilt helpers, create custom helpers, or send per-message context to provide more relevant AI responses.

## How additional context works

When configured, context helpers automatically add metadata to messages without extra code in your components. This contextual information helps the AI:

- Provide time-aware responses (e.g., "Good morning" at the right time)
- Understand what page or section the user is currently viewing
- Give location-specific recommendations
- Provide more relevant help based on the user's current context
- Access custom business logic and application state

## How to Add Context

There are five ways to add additional context to messages:

### 1. Prebuilt Context Helpers

Tambo provides prebuilt helper functions that can be passed to the provider:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import {
  currentTimeContextHelper,
  currentPageContextHelper,
} from "@tambo-ai/react";

<TamboProvider
  contextHelpers={{
    userTime: currentTimeContextHelper,
    userPage: currentPageContextHelper,
  }}
/>;
```

You can also wrap parts of your app with `TamboContextHelpersProvider` to declare helpers in-place. This is useful when you don't want to set `contextHelpers` at the root, or when you need page/layout-specific helpers that only apply while that page is mounted:

```tsx
import { TamboContextHelpersProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { currentPageContextHelper } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <TamboContextHelpersProvider
      contextHelpers={{
        // Registers only while this page is mounted
        userPage: currentPageContextHelper,
      }}
    >
      {/* Components that send messages (e.g., MessageThreadFull, inputs, etc.) */}
    </TamboContextHelpersProvider>
  );
}
```

This is equivalent to passing the same helpers via `TamboProvider`’s `contextHelpers` prop. If the same key is registered in multiple places at different times, the most recently mounted registration takes effect while it’s mounted.

### 2. Custom Context Helpers

Create your own helpers to automatically include application-specific data. Each helper is a function that returns a value, or null to skip.

```tsx
// Define helpers outside components
const profileHelper = async () => ({
  userId: getCurrentUserId(),
  role: getUserRole(),
  preferences: await getUserPreferences(),
});

<TamboProvider
  contextHelpers={{
    // The key becomes the context name
    userProfile: profileHelper,

    // Or define inline
    appState: async () => ({
      theme: getTheme(),
      version: getAppVersion(),
    }),
  }}
/>;
```

### 3. Manual Context via Message Functions

Add custom context on a per-message basis using the `additionalContext` parameter:

```tsx
// Using useTamboThreadInput hook
const { submit } = useTamboThreadInput();

await submit({
  streamResponse: true,
  additionalContext: {
    customData: "specific to this message",
    userPreferences: { theme: "dark" },
  },
});
```

### 4. Context Attachments

Stage context pieces that will be automatically included in the next user message. Context attachments are registered as a context helper (key: `contextAttachments`) and are automatically cleared after submission (one-time use).

```tsx
import { useTamboContextAttachment } from "@tambo-ai/react";

function FileViewer({ file }) {
  const { addContextAttachment } = useTamboContextAttachment();

  const handleSelectFile = () => {
    // Stage file content for the next message
    addContextAttachment({
      context: file.content,
      displayName: file.name,
      type: "file",
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleSelectFile}>Focus on {file.name}</button>;
}
```

### 5. Resources

Register data sources that users can reference in messages using @ mentions. Resources allow users to explicitly pull in documentation, files, or other content from local or MCP sources.

```tsx
import { useTamboLocalResources } from "@tambo-ai/react";

const { registerLocalResource } = useTamboLocalResources();

registerLocalResource({
  uri: "docs://api-guide",
  name: "API Guide",
  description: "Complete API documentation",
  mimeType: "text/plain",
  text: "API documentation content...",
});
```

Users reference resources in messages with `@resourceUri` syntax. The resource content is included as part of the message when sent.

All five methods can be used together—context from helpers, context attachments, manual context, and resources are merged when sending messages.

## Complementary Context Methods

Beyond the message-level context above, Tambo provides additional ways to provide context with different characteristics:

### System Messages

Set persistent instructions and behavioral guidelines for an entire conversation thread. System messages are set once at thread creation and remain in effect for the thread's lifetime, making them ideal for defining AI persona, domain expertise, or persistent constraints.

```tsx
import { useTamboThread } from "@tambo-ai/react";

const { createThread } = useTamboThread();

await createThread({
  initialMessages: [
    {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      role: "system",
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: "You are a financial advisor specializing in retirement planning.",
        },
      ],
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      componentState: {},
    },
  ],
});
```

System messages are best for instructions that don't change during the conversation, while context helpers excel at dynamic data that updates between messages.

### Resources from MCP Servers

When you connect MCP servers, their resources become available for users to reference in messages. MCP resources work the same way as local resources—users reference them with @ mentions, and their content is included in the message.

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

<TamboProvider
  mcpServers={[
    {
      serverKey: "linear",
      transport: { type: "sse", url: "/api/mcp/linear" },
    },
  ]}
>
  {/* Users can now reference Linear resources like @linear:issue://TAM-123 */}
</TamboProvider>;
```

MCP resources are particularly valuable for integrating external services like Linear, GitHub, databases, or file systems into your AI conversations.

## When to Use Each Method

| Method              | Use When                                                          | Example                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prebuilt Helpers    | You need standard metadata like time or page info                 | Use `currentTimeContextHelper` for scheduling features                           |
| Custom Helpers      | You have app-wide context that should always be included          | User profile, app settings, feature flags                                        |
| Manual Context      | Context is specific to a particular interaction                   | Search filters, form data, temporary state                                       |
| Context Attachments | You want to stage context that will be sent with the next message | File contents, selected text, temporary context that should be cleared after use |
| Resources           | Users need to reference documentation or files in messages        | API documentation, configuration files, user-uploaded documents                  |
| System Messages     | You need persistent instructions for an entire thread             | AI persona, domain expertise, behavioral constraints                             |
| MCP Resources       | You have structured reference materials from external servers     | Linear issues, GitHub files, database records from MCP servers                   |

## Available Prebuilt Context Helpers (On by Default)

These helpers are automatically enabled when using the corresponding provider. You can disable them by overriding them with a function that returns null.

### currentTimeContextHelper

Provides the user's current time and timezone information.

Example result:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T20:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### currentPageContextHelper

Provides information about the current page or route.

Example result:

```json
{
  "url": "/dashboard/analytics",
  "title": "Analytics Dashboard"
}
```

### currentInteractablesContextHelper

**Automatically enabled** when using `TamboInteractableProvider`. Provides information about all interactable components currently on the page that the AI can read and modify.

We found this to be the most effective way to provide the AI with information about the current page and the components on the page. It's easy to disable or customize as needed.

Example result:

```json
{
  "description": "These are the interactable components currently visible on the page...",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "Note-abc123",
      "componentName": "Note",
      "description": "A simple note",
      "props": { "title": "My Note", "content": "Hello world" },
      "propsSchema": "Available - use component-specific update tools"
    }
  ]
}
```

See [Interactable Components](/concepts/components/interactable-components) for details on customizing or disabling this helper.

**Notes:**

- Helpers are plain functions. Return a value to include it, or null/undefined to skip.
- The helper key becomes the context name in messages.
