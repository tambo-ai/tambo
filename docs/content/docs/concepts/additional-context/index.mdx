description: Add additional information along with user's message

Additional Context helps you add information that will be sent along with the user's message. You can include prebuilt helpers, create custom helpers, or send per-message context to provide more relevant AI responses.

## Overview

When configured, context helpers automatically add metadata to messages without extra code in your components. This contextual information helps the AI:

- Provide time-aware responses (e.g., "Good morning" at the right time)
- Understand what page or section the user is currently viewing
- Give location-specific recommendations
- Provide more relevant help based on the user's current context
- Access custom business logic and application state

## How to Add Context

There are three ways to add additional context to messages:

### 1. Prebuilt Context Helpers

Tambo provides prebuilt helper functions that can be passed to the provider:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { getUserTime, getUserPage } from "@tambo-ai/react";

<TamboProvider
  contextHelpers={{
    userTime: getUserTime,
    userPage: getUserPage,
  }}
/>;
```

You can also wrap parts of your app with `TamboContextHelpersProvider` to declare helpers in-place. This is useful when you don't want to set `contextHelpers` at the root, or when you need page/layout-specific helpers that only apply while that page is mounted:

```tsx
import { TamboContextHelpersProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { getUserPage } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <TamboContextHelpersProvider
      contextHelpers={{
        // Registers only while this page is mounted
        userPage: getUserPage,
      }}
    >
      {/* Components that send messages (e.g., MessageThreadFull, inputs, etc.) */}
    </TamboContextHelpersProvider>
  );
}
```

This is equivalent to passing the same helpers via `TamboProvider`’s `contextHelpers` prop. If the same key is registered in multiple places at different times, the most recently mounted registration takes effect while it’s mounted.

### 2. Custom Context Helpers

Create your own helpers to automatically include application-specific data. Each helper is a function that returns a value, or null to skip.

```tsx
// Define helpers outside components
const profileHelper = async () => ({
  userId: getCurrentUserId(),
  role: getUserRole(),
  preferences: await getUserPreferences(),
});

<TamboProvider
  contextHelpers={{
    // The key becomes the context name
    userProfile: profileHelper,

    // Or define inline
    appState: async () => ({
      theme: getTheme(),
      version: getAppVersion(),
    }),
  }}
/>;
```

### 3. Manual Context via Message Functions

Add custom context on a per-message basis using the `additionalContext` parameter:

```tsx
// Using useTamboThreadInput hook
const { submit } = useTamboThreadInput();

await submit({
  streamResponse: true,
  additionalContext: {
    customData: "specific to this message",
    userPreferences: { theme: "dark" },
  },
});
```

All three methods can be used together—context from helpers and manual context are merged when sending messages.

## When to Use Each Method

| Method           | Use When                                                 | Example                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Prebuilt Helpers | You need standard metadata like time or page info        | Use `getUserTime` for scheduling features  |
| Custom Helpers   | You have app-wide context that should always be included | User profile, app settings, feature flags  |
| Manual Context   | Context is specific to a particular interaction          | Search filters, form data, temporary state |

## Available Prebuilt Context Helpers

### userTime

Provides the user's current time and timezone information.

Example result:

```json
{
  "iso": "2025-01-15T20:30:00.000Z",
  "timezoneOffsetMinutes": -300
}
```

### userPage

Provides information about the current page or route.

Example result:

```json
{
  "url": "/dashboard/analytics",
  "title": "Analytics Dashboard"
}
```

**Notes:**

- Helpers are plain functions. Return a value to include it, or null/undefined to skip.
- The helper key becomes the context name in messages.
