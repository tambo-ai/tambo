Resources give users a way to explicitly pull documentation, files, or other content into their messages. Instead of the AI querying for resources on-demand, users reference them with @ mentions, and the content is included when the message is sent.

Think of resources as a searchable library that users can browse and cite in their conversations.

## How Resources Work

Resources are push-based, not pull-based. When a user types `@` in the message input, they see available resources, select what they want, and that content gets included in the message as it's sent. The AI doesn't query for resources later—it receives them upfront as part of the message context.

This is different from some systems where the AI discovers and fetches resources on its own. With Tambo, **users control** what resources to include and when.

## Two Types of Resources

Resources can come from two sources, but both work identically from the user's perspective:

**Local resources**: Registered directly in your React app
- Documentation you author
- Configuration files
- User-uploaded documents
- Application data exported as resources

**MCP resources**: Exposed by connected MCP servers
- External services (Linear issues, GitHub files)
- Database records
- File systems
- Third-party integrations

Both types appear in the same @ mention picker. Users type `@`, search for what they need, and select it.

## Local Resources

Register resources directly in your React app for documentation, configuration, or user-uploaded files:

```tsx
import { useTamboLocalResources } from "@tambo-ai/react";

const { registerLocalResource } = useTamboLocalResources();

registerLocalResource({
  uri: "docs://getting-started",
  name: "Getting Started Guide",
  description: "Introduction to our product",
  mimeType: "text/plain",
  text: "Welcome to our product! Here's how to get started...",
});
```

## MCP Resources

Connect MCP servers to expose resources from external services like Linear, GitHub, or databases:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

<TamboProvider
  mcpServers={[
    {
      serverKey: "linear",
      transport: { type: "sse", url: "/api/mcp/linear" },
    },
  ]}
>
  <App />
</TamboProvider>;
```

Users can then reference Linear issues with `@linear:issue://TAM-123` in their messages.

## When to Use Resources

**Use resources when:**
- Users need to reference specific documentation or files in their messages
- Content should only be included when explicitly requested (not every message)
- You want to provide searchable, browsable content that users can discover
- You have large documents that would overwhelm automatic context

**Use context helpers instead when:**
- Context should be automatically included with every message
- You need dynamic data like current time, page, or user state
- Context is small and always relevant

Resources give users control over what context to include, while context helpers provide automatic ambient context.
