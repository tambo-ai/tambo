description: Allow users to reference documentation and files in messages through @ mentions
---

Resources are data sources that users can explicitly reference in their messages using @ mentions. Unlike context helpers that automatically run with each message, resources are user-controlled—users choose when to include them by typing `@resourceName` in their message.

Resources can come from two sources:
- **Local resources**: Registered directly in your React app
- **MCP resources**: Exposed by connected MCP servers

Both types work the same way from the user's perspective—they type @ to search and select resources, and the content is included in the message when sent.

## Local Resources

Register resources directly in your React app for documentation, configuration, or user-uploaded files:

```tsx
import { useTamboLocalResources } from "@tambo-ai/react";

const { registerLocalResource } = useTamboLocalResources();

registerLocalResource({
  uri: "docs://getting-started",
  name: "Getting Started Guide",
  description: "Introduction to our product",
  mimeType: "text/plain",
  text: "Welcome to our product! Here's how to get started...",
});
```

## MCP Resources

Connect MCP servers to expose resources from external services like Linear, GitHub, or databases:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

<TamboProvider
  mcpServers={[
    {
      serverKey: "linear",
      transport: { type: "sse", url: "/api/mcp/linear" },
    },
  ]}
>
  <App />
</TamboProvider>;
```

Users can then reference Linear issues with `@linear:issue://TAM-123` in their messages.

## When to Use Resources

**Use resources when:**
- Users need to reference specific documentation or files in their messages
- Content should only be included when explicitly requested (not every message)
- You want to provide searchable, browsable content that users can discover
- You have large documents that would overwhelm automatic context

**Use context helpers instead when:**
- Context should be automatically included with every message
- You need dynamic data like current time, page, or user state
- Context is small and always relevant

Resources give users control over what context to include, while context helpers provide automatic ambient context.
