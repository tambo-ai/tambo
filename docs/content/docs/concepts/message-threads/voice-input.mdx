### Voice input

Users can record audio messages instead of typing. The audio is transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model through your backend.

## Using MessageInput with voice

The `MessageInput` component provides built-in voice input functionality. Simply add the `MessageInputVoiceButton` component:

```tsx
import {
  MessageInput,
  MessageInputTextarea,
  MessageInputVoiceButton,
  MessageInputSubmitButton,
  MessageInputToolbar,
} from "@tambo-ai/react";

function ChatInterface() {
  return (
    <MessageInput contextKey="my-chat">
      <MessageInputTextarea placeholder="Type or record a message..." />
      <MessageInputToolbar>
        <MessageInputVoiceButton />
        <MessageInputSubmitButton />
      </MessageInputToolbar>
    </MessageInput>
  );
}
```

## Real-time transcription

For live transcription as you speak, enable `realTimeMode`:

```tsx
<MessageInputVoiceButton realTimeMode={true} />
```

This will transcribe your speech in real-time while you're recording, updating the text input as you speak.

## Voice input requirements

Voice input requires:
- **HTTPS connection** (or localhost for development)
- **Browser support** for MediaRecorder API
- **User permission** to access the microphone

## How it works

**Batch mode (default):**
1. Click the microphone button to start recording
2. Speak your message
3. Click the button again to stop recording
4. Audio is transcribed and appears in the text input
5. Review and edit the transcription if needed
6. Submit your message

**Real-time mode:**
1. Click the microphone button to start recording
2. Speak your message - text appears as you speak
3. Click the button again to stop recording
4. Review and edit the transcription if needed
5. Submit your message
