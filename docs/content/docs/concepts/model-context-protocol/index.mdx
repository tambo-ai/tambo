title: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
description: Connect Tambo to external tools and services using the MCP standard.
---

Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows you to give Tambo access to tools defined by other people. Many popular services publish MCP servers, and Tambo provides a simple way to connect to them. This is a quick way to allow your users to conversationally interact with other services without needing to write any of the interaction code yourself.

## Connection Types

Tambo supports two ways to connect to MCP servers:

1. **[Server-side MCP](/concepts/model-context-protocol/providers/serverside-mcp-connection)** (recommended) - Configure MCP servers through the Tambo dashboard. Best for shared services, OAuth authentication, and optimal performance.

2. **[Client-side MCP](/concepts/model-context-protocol/providers/clientside-mcp-connection)** - Connect directly from the browser to MCP servers accessible to end users. Best for local servers and user-specific services.

## Quick Start

```tsx
<TamboProvider
  mcpServers={[
    {
      // MCP server configuration
      url: "http://some-mcp-endpoint.com",
      // Optional stable prefix used when multiple MCP servers are configured
      // If omitted, a key is derived from the URL hostname
      serverKey: "external",
      // Optional custom headers, eg.
      // { "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}` } or { "X-Api-Key": "1234567890" }
      customHeaders: {},
      transport: MCPTransport.HTTP, // optional, defaults to HTTP
    },
  ]}
>
  <App />
</TamboProvider>
```

Tambo **always prefixes** prompts, resources, and tools with the `serverKey` to identify which MCP server they come from:

- Prompts: `serverKey:promptName`
- Resources: `serverKey:serverSidePrefix:resourceUri` (server-side) or `serverKey:resourceUri` (client-side)
- Tools: `serverKey__toolName`

If you don't specify `serverKey`, Tambo derives one from the server URL (for example, `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp` becomes `linear`); see [Server namespacing](/concepts/model-context-protocol/providers/clientside-mcp-connection#server-namespacing) for more details. For predictable behavior across environments, set `serverKey` explicitly. Avoid `:` and `__` in the `serverKey` (since prompts/resources use `:` and tools use `__` as separators); prefer letters, numbers, `_`, and `-`.
