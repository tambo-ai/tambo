title: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
description: Connect Tambo to external tools and services using the MCP standard.
---

Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows you to give Tambo access to tools defined by other people. Many popular services publish MCP servers, and Tambo provides a simple way to connect to them. This is a quick way to allow your users to conversationally interact with other services without needing to write any of the interaction code yourself.

## Connection Types

Tambo supports two ways to connect to MCP servers:

1. **[Server-side MCP](/concepts/model-context-protocol/serverside-mcp-connection)** (recommended) - Configure MCP servers through the Tambo dashboard. Best for shared services, OAuth authentication, and optimal performance.

2. **[Client-side MCP](/concepts/model-context-protocol/clientside-mcp-connection)** - Connect directly from the browser to MCP servers accessible to end users. Best for local servers and user-specific services.

## Quick Start

```tsx
<TamboProvider>
  <TamboMcpProvider
    mcpServers={[
      {
        // MCP server configuration
        url: "http://some-mcp-endpoint.com",
        // Optional custom headers, eg.
        // { "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}` } or { "X-Api-Key": "1234567890" }
        customHeaders: {},
        transport: MCPTransport.HTTP, // optional, defaults to SSE
      },
    ]}
  >
    <App />
  </TamboMcpProvider>
</TamboProvider>
```
