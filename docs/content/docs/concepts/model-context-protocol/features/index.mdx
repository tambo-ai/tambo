description: Feature support for Model Context Protocol capabilities in Tambo
---

Tambo supports various Model Context Protocol features that enable rich interactions between your application and MCP servers. Below is a summary of currently supported features.

## Supported Features

| Feature | Support Status | Description | Documentation |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Tools** | ✅ Supported | Call functions exposed by MCP servers to perform actions and retrieve data | Coming soon |
| **Elicitations** | ✅ Supported | Request additional input from users during tool execution with dynamic forms | [View docs](/concepts/model-context-protocol/features/elicitation) |
| **Sampling** | ✅ Supported | Allow MCP servers to request LLM completions through your application | Coming soon |
| **Prompts** | ✅ Supported | Use predefined prompt templates from MCP servers | Coming soon |
| **Resources** | ⏳ Planned | Access data and content exposed by MCP servers | Coming soon |

## Feature Details

### Tools

MCP tools are automatically discovered and made available to Tambo when you connect to an MCP server (either client-side or server-side). The AI can call these tools to perform actions like creating issues, fetching data, or interacting with external services.

Tools support rich content responses, including text, images, and other media types that are seamlessly passed to the AI.

### Elicitations

Elicitations allow MCP servers to pause during tool execution and request additional information from users. Tambo provides built-in UI components that automatically render dynamic forms based on the requested schema, handle validation, and return responses to the MCP server.

### Sampling

Sampling enables MCP servers to request LLM completions through your application. This allows MCP tools to leverage AI capabilities for tasks like generating text, analyzing content, or making decisions based on context.

### Prompts

Prompts allow MCP servers to expose reusable prompt templates that can be invoked by your application. This enables standardized workflows and consistent prompt patterns across different tools and services.

### Future Features

**Resources** will enable MCP servers to expose data sources and content that can be dynamically accessed and used by the AI.

## Connection Types

MCP features work with both connection types:

- **[Server-side MCP](/concepts/model-context-protocol/serverside-mcp-connection)** - Configured through the Tambo dashboard
- **[Client-side MCP](/concepts/model-context-protocol/clientside-mcp-connection)** - Connected directly from the browser

Different features may have different capabilities or requirements depending on the connection type. Check the specific documentation for each feature for details.
