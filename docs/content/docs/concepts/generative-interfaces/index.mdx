Traditional UIs are fixed. Users navigate menus, fill forms, and click through screens that developers pre-built. To see sales data, you find the dashboard, apply filters, configure the view. The interface doesn't adapt to you.

Generative interfaces flip this. Users describe what they want, and the UI renders in real-time. "Show me sales data" produces an actual interactive chart with your data. The interface adapts to users.

## How Tambo works

### Use Your Existing UI Components

Tambo doesn't generate UI from scratch. You build React components and register them with descriptions. Tambo picks the right one based on user messages.

Two patterns:

**[Generative components](/concepts/generative-interfaces/generative-components)** — Tambo creates new instances in response to messages. User asks for information, Tambo selects a component, generates the props, and streams it into the conversation.

**[Interactable components](/concepts/generative-interfaces/interactable-components)** — Tambo updates components already on screen. You place them in your UI, Tambo reads their state and modifies them through conversation.

Both work together. A user asks Tambo to create a chart (generative), then later says "update the filters on my dashboard" (interactable).

### Component selection

When a user sends a message, Tambo analyzes it against registered components and tools. It considers the message meaning, conversation history, and component descriptions. Then it picks the best match.

A message about displaying data might match a chart. A request to edit information maps to a form. This happens automatically.

### Rendering

Generative components appear in the response message. The component becomes part of the conversation—text and interactive elements together.

You control where they display. Components can render in a chat interface or anywhere in your app. Dashboards, forms, whatever layout you need. You're not locked into chat-style UIs.

Rendering happens in real-time. Users see props stream in as Tambo generates them.
