When you want to place specific components on screen rather than letting Tambo choose which to show, but still want to allow your users to interact with them using natural language, use Tambo's Interactable components. Unlike [generative components](/concepts/generative-interfaces/generative-components) that Tambo creates on-demand when responding to messages, Interactable components are **pre-placed by you** while still allowing Tambo to modify their props when responding to users.

You place them, set their initial state, and users can interact with them directly like any other React component. Simultaneously, Tambo can observe their current props values and update them through natural language requests.

This creates a conversational interface where traditional UI manipulation (clicking, typing) and natural language interaction work together. A user might click to edit a note's title, then ask Tambo to "update the content with today's meeting notes," both modifying the same component.

## How Interactables Work

When you wrap a component with `withInteractable`, Tambo creates an automatic bidirectional connection:

**Automatic Context Sending**: The current props of the component are visible to Tambo automatically.

**Automatic Tool Registration**: Update tools are automatically registered to allow Tambo to update the component's props when needed.
