## Getting Started with tambo

### What is tambo

Tambo is a frontend toolkit and developer experience around building with the Tambo platform. The project is split across:

- **tambo app and component library**: UI components and developer tooling
- **[apps/api](./apps/api/) (API/backend)**: Core APIs and services powering the platform
- **TypeScript SDK**: Auto-generated client built from the API using Stainless

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm 11+
- Git

Optional but useful:

- Docker (for running backend services locally if needed)
- A modern browser for local development and component testing

### Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tambo.git
cd tambo
npm install
```

If the repo uses workspaces/monorepo, `pnpm` will bootstrap all packages.

### Common scripts

Check `package.json` for the authoritative scripts. Typical commands:

```bash
# Start development (showcase + docs per repo scripts)
npm run dev

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Lint and fix
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Type-check
npm run check-types

# Run tests
npm test
```

If the project is a multi-package repo, you can run scripts from the workspace root. Advanced, package-scoped commands can be run with npm’s workspace flags (e.g., `npm run dev -w @tambo-ai/showcase`).

### Environment configuration

Some features require API access. You can point the app/SDK to a local or remote backend:

- `API_BASE_URL` or similar environment variable (see `.env.example` if present)
- For local API development, run the backend from the [apps/api directory](./apps/api/) and point the frontend to it

Refer to the backend docs in the [apps/api directory](./apps/api/) for environment and service setup.

### Working with the API and SDK

- The TypeScript SDK is auto-generated by Stainless based on the API schema. Do not edit the SDK by hand.
- To change SDK behavior, propose/merge an API change in [apps/api](./apps/api/); after deploy, the SDK will regenerate automatically over the next hour.
- For API questions or server setup, see [apps/api](./apps/api/)

AI-generated code must be reviewed by a human and follow our internal AI rules.

### Developing components

- Run the component playground/showcase to iterate on UI components quickly
- Add stories/examples so new or changed components are visible in the showcase
- Ensure visual changes include a short video demo in the PR (≤ 2 minutes)

### Documentation

All user-facing changes must include documentation updates in the docs site. When adding components, update:

- Reference docs (props, usage, examples)
- Guides or tutorials if applicable
- The component showcase so reviewers can verify changes visually

### CLI integration

If your change adds a new component or developer command, update the CLI so the new component can be scaffolded/added via the CLI. Include a brief example in the docs.

### Troubleshooting

- If install fails, ensure you are on Node 22+ and npm 11+
- Clear caches: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Check env vars are loaded (restart the dev server after changing `.env`)
- Verify the backend is reachable when testing API features
