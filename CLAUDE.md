# CLAUDE.md

Guidelines for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when touching this repo.

**Read @AGENTS.md first.** It owns architecture, naming, workflow rules, testing expectations, and anything code-related. Keep that file open—this doc just points you there.

## Three Things to Remember

1. Follow that doc for everything: repo layout, commands, coding standards, doc rules, Charlie workflow, MCP guidance, etc.
2. Use the workspace scripts it lists (`npm run dev`, `npm run lint`, `npm run check-types`, `npm test`, `npm run db:*`, Docker helpers in `scripts/cloud/`, …).
3. Defer to it whenever instructions collide; if something’s still unclear, ask the user.

That’s it—keep this doc minimal so every agent gets one authoritative direction.
