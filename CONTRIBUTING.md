## Contributing to tambo

Thank you for contributing! This guide outlines our workflow and the quality bar for changes. Please read it end-to-end before opening a PR.

### Code of Conduct

By participating, you agree to uphold a respectful, inclusive environment. Be kind, constructive, and collaborative.

### Workflow overview

1. Open or pick up an issue.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Implement your change with tests and docs.
4. Open a PR with a semantic versioning title and the checklist below.
5. Get at least one approval and a green CI run.

### PR titles and semantic versioning (required)

We infer release impact from PR titles using Conventional Commits semantics. Use one of:

- `feat(scope): add something` → Minor version bump
- `fix(scope): fix something` → Patch version bump
- `perf(scope): ...`, `refactor(scope): ...`, `docs(scope): ...`, `chore(scope): ...` → Typically patch or no release
- `feat(scope)!: breaking change summary` or include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → Major version bump

Examples:

- `feat(button): add destructive variant`
- `fix(table): restore keyboard navigation`
- `feat(api)!: remove deprecated v1 endpoints`

Scopes are usually package or area names (e.g., `button`, `cli`, `docs`, `sdk`). Keep titles clear and imperative.

### TypeScript SDK policy (Stainless-generated)

- The TypeScript SDK is auto-generated by Stainless from the API schema.
- Do not modify the SDK by hand. Instead, land the API change in [tambo-cloud](./tambo-cloud/); when deployed, the SDK will be regenerated by automation.
- If you need new client behavior, propose it via API changes or helper utilities that wrap the generated client in this repo (not edits to generated files).

### Visual changes require a short video demo

Any PR that changes visuals (new component, component behavior/style, or UI in [tambo](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo)) must include a brief demo video (≤ 2 minutes). Loom links are fine. Show:

- Where to find the feature
- Before vs after (if applicable)
- Key interactions and edge cases

### Documentation is mandatory

All changes must update our documentation site. Include:

- Updated reference pages (props, usage, examples)
- New guides or tutorial steps if introducing concepts
- Migration notes if behavior changes

Link the docs PR or commit in your PR description.

### Component library changes must update showcase and CLI

- Add or update examples in the component showcase so reviewers can validate visually
- Update the CLI so new components can be scaffolded/added by the CLI
- Add a minimal usage example to the docs and CLI help output where applicable

### AI-generated code policy

- Any AI-generated code must be reviewed by a human and brought up to our readability, testing, and documentation standards.
- Follow our internal AI rules/policy document (link internally). Do not include secrets or customer data in prompts.

### Quality bar

- TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier must pass: `pnpm -w lint` and `pnpm -w typecheck`
- Tests must pass locally and in CI: `pnpm -w test`
- Add tests for new logic and meaningful changes
- Keep functions small, well-named, and guard edge cases early

### PR checklist (include in description)

- [ ] Semantic PR title using Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `!` for breaking)
- [ ] Linked issue(s)
- [ ] If SDK needed: confirm it will be regenerated by Stainless (no manual SDK edits)
- [ ] JSDoc updated in code where relevant
- [ ] Docs site updated (pages/examples/CLI help), or a separate doc PR is linked
- [ ] Visual change demo video attached (≤ 2 min)
- [ ] Showcase updated for component changes
- [ ] CLI updated to support new components or options
- [ ] Tests added/updated and all CI checks green

### Branching, commits, and reviews

- Branch from `main`, rebase as needed to keep history clean
- Use small, focused commits with clear messages (Conventional Commits encouraged, but PR title governs versioning)
- At least one reviewer approval required; request experts for API or design-heavy changes

### Releases

- We follow Semantic Versioning (semver). Release type is derived from PR titles and/or maintainer input
- Changelogs are generated by CI (or maintainers) based on merged PRs
- Maintainers may squash and edit titles to reflect the correct semver impact
