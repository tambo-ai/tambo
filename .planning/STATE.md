## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3 phases derived -- bridge, inspection panels, streaming visibility
- [Roadmap]: COMP category split -- static registry views (COMP-01/02/03) in Phase 2, streaming views (COMP-04/05/06) in Phase 3

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: WebSocket server hosting in Next.js needs a spike during Phase 1 planning. Next.js does not natively support WS in API routes -- options are custom server, separate process, or NestJS gateway.
- [Research]: Cross-origin WebSocket connection URL discovery needs design if developers use hosted Tambo Cloud dashboard.
