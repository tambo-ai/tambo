# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-11)

**Core value:** The CLI should feel magic — run one command and your app is Tambo-enabled with the right components registered, tools created, and a working chat widget, all tailored to what's actually in the codebase.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Client Core SDK

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Build client-core as separate package (eventually replaces API layer in react-sdk; CLI needs non-React access to Tambo API)
- Phase 3+: Model handles code changes via tool calls (more flexible than templates; adapts to any codebase structure)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
