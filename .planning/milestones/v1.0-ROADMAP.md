# Milestone v1.0: Tambo DevTools — Archived Roadmap

**Completed:** 2026-02-12
**Phases:** 3 (9 plans total)
**Stats:** 62 files changed, ~8,800 lines added

## Overview

Tambo DevTools delivers browser-based debugging for Tambo-powered applications in three phases: WebSocket bridge between SDK and dashboard, core inspection panels (thread state, component registry, filtering), and real-time streaming visibility (event timeline, component streaming visualizer, tool call lifecycle).

## Key Accomplishments

1. **WebSocket Bridge** — Standalone WS server on port 8265 with partysocket SDK client, auto-reconnect, production-safe `@tambo-ai/react/devtools` subpath export with zero bundle cost when not imported
2. **Thread Inspector** — Thread list with status badges, message detail view with content block rendering (text/component/tool_use/tool_result), collapsible JSON tree viewer, streaming state badges
3. **Component Registry & Error Visibility** — Registry panel showing components, tools, and MCP servers with schema inspection; error banner surfacing streaming/tool/connection errors; filter bar with search
4. **Real-time Event Timeline** — Chronological color-coded timeline of AG-UI events with RAF-batched rendering, ring buffer (5000 cap), scroll-position virtualization, and click-to-inspect detail view
5. **Component Streaming Visualizer** — Per-component lifecycle tracking (started → streaming → done), JSON Patch operation log, cumulative props display
6. **Tool Call Lifecycle Panel** — Events grouped by toolCallId with status badges (calling → args complete → awaiting input → complete), accumulated args and result display

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: WebSocket Bridge (Complete 2026-02-12)

**Goal**: Developers can connect their running Tambo app to the dashboard and see proof of a live connection
**Requirements**: INFRA-01 through INFRA-06

Plans:

- 01-01: Wire protocol types, DevToolsBridge client (partysocket), TamboDevTools component, subpath export
- 01-02: Standalone WebSocket server, connection manager, dashboard hook, dev:cloud auto-start
- 01-03: DevTools dashboard page with connection status UI, client cards, e2e verification

### Phase 2: Inspection Panels (Complete 2026-02-12)

**Goal**: Developers can inspect thread state, messages, component registrations, and tool registrations in real-time
**Requirements**: STATE-01 through STATE-08, COMP-01 through COMP-03

Plans:

- 02-01: Enriched wire protocol, snapshot serializer, SDK bridge emission, dashboard hook extension
- 02-02: Thread list panel, message detail view, content block viewer, JSON tree inspector
- 02-03: Registry panel, schema viewer, error banner, filtering, and search

### Phase 3: Streaming Visibility (Complete 2026-02-12)

**Goal**: Developers can observe the real-time streaming lifecycle as it happens
**Requirements**: COMP-04 through COMP-06, STRM-01 through STRM-06

Plans:

- 03-01: Wire protocol extension with stream_event, SDK event capture, server forwarding
- 03-02: Event timeline panel with ring buffer, color-coding, virtualized rendering
- 03-03: Component streaming visualizer and tool call lifecycle view

## Key Decisions

| Decision                                         | Rationale                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Standalone WS server on port 8265                | Avoids NestJS gateway complexity and next-ws patches |
| partysocket for SDK, native WS for dashboard     | Auto-reconnect for SDK; simpler for dashboard        |
| Protocol types defined independently per side    | No cross-package TS imports needed                   |
| `@tambo-ai/react/devtools` subpath export        | Zero bundle cost in production                       |
| RawEventCallbackContext for event tap            | Read-only, zero-overhead when devtools not mounted   |
| Ring buffer + RAF batching + virtualization      | Handles 50-100 events/sec without jank               |
| Cumulative props from snapshot, not patch replay | Reliable even if dashboard misses events             |
