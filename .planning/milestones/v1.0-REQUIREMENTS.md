# Milestone v1.0: Tambo DevTools — Archived Requirements

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Completed:** 2026-02-12
**Core Value:** Developers can see exactly what's happening inside their Tambo app without resorting to console.log or manual network tab inspection.

## v1 Requirements (26/26 Complete)

### Infrastructure (Phase 1)

- [x] **INFRA-01**: SDK emits dev-tools events via websocket to a locally running dashboard
- [x] **INFRA-02**: Dashboard receives and processes websocket events from connected SDK instances
- [x] **INFRA-03**: Connection status indicator shows connected/disconnected/reconnecting state, project ID, and SDK version
- [x] **INFRA-04**: Websocket auto-reconnects on disconnect with backoff
- [x] **INFRA-05**: Dev-tools code is excluded from production builds via separate entry point (`@tambo-ai/react/devtools`) with zero bundle cost when not imported
- [x] **INFRA-06**: Dev-tools bridge activates only when explicitly opted in (not just dev mode)

### State Inspection (Phase 2)

- [x] **STATE-01**: User can see a list of all threads with name, status (idle/streaming/waiting), and timestamps
- [x] **STATE-02**: User can select a thread and see all messages with role, content blocks, and timestamps
- [x] **STATE-03**: User can inspect any content block (text, component, tool_use, tool_result) with full detail
- [x] **STATE-04**: User can view current streaming state (status, runId, messageId, error) for active threads
- [x] **STATE-05**: User can expand any nested data structure via a collapsible JSON tree viewer
- [x] **STATE-06**: Streaming errors, tool call failures, and connection issues are surfaced prominently (not buried in state trees)
- [x] **STATE-07**: User can filter threads by status and messages by role or content type
- [x] **STATE-08**: User can search across message content and tool names via text search

### Component Debugging (Phases 2 & 3)

- [x] **COMP-01**: User can view all registered components with name, description, and prop schema
- [x] **COMP-02**: User can view all registered tools with name, description, and input schema
- [x] **COMP-03**: User can view connected MCP servers and registered resources
- [x] **COMP-04**: User can see JSON Patch operations as they arrive for a streaming component
- [x] **COMP-05**: User can see cumulative props/state for a component as patches are applied
- [x] **COMP-06**: User can see the streaming lifecycle of a component (started -> streaming -> done)

### Streaming & Events (Phase 3)

- [x] **STRM-01**: User can see a chronological timeline of all AG-UI events as they arrive in real-time
- [x] **STRM-02**: Events in the timeline are timestamped and color-coded by type
- [x] **STRM-03**: User can click an event in the timeline to see its full payload
- [x] **STRM-04**: User can see the full tool call lifecycle: start, accumulated args, end, and result
- [x] **STRM-05**: User can see client-side tool execution status (awaiting input -> executing -> result)
- [x] **STRM-06**: Timeline handles high-frequency events (per-token deltas) without UI jank

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Interactivity

- **INTX-01**: User can resend a message to retry a failed run
- **INTX-02**: User can cancel a currently streaming run from the dashboard
- **INTX-03**: User can manually trigger a tool with custom arguments
- **INTX-04**: Dashboard communicates commands back to SDK via bidirectional websocket

### Advanced Debugging

- **ADVD-01**: User can see component resolution trace (why AI chose a component, schema validation)
- **ADVD-02**: User can see model reasoning/thinking tokens in real-time
- **ADVD-03**: User can record and replay a streaming session for debugging
- **ADVD-04**: User can view tool-component associations and their resolution logic

## Out of Scope

| Feature                 | Reason                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Full LLM observability  | LangSmith/Langfuse territory         |
| Browser extension       | Dashboard-hosted approach is simpler |
| Performance profiler    | React DevTools covers this           |
| Visual component editor | Over-engineering for v1              |
| Production debugging    | Security/auth complexity             |
| Time-travel debugging   | Non-deterministic AI state           |
| Embedded in-app panel   | Dashboard approach is right for v1   |
